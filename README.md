## How to run (linux instructions)

  Pre-requirement: MongoDB must be installed and running.
  
  Install all the dependencies listed in the packages.json through the following command:
    
    npm install
  
  In order to start the server, just run:
  
    npm start
  
  The default port is 3000. If you want to use another one, just set the PORT env var with the desired value:
  
    PORT=<port_number> npm start

  The application will be available through the following URL:
  
    http://localhost:<port_number>
